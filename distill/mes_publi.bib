	abstract = {Estimating the epidemic potential of vector-borne diseases, along with the relative contribution of underlying mechanisms, is crucial for animal and human health worldwide. In West African Sahel, several outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) have occurred over the last decades, but uncertainty remains about the conditions necessary to trigger these outbreaks. We use the basic reproduction number (R0) as a measure of RVF epidemic potential in northern Senegal, and map its value in two distinct ecosystems, namely the Ferlo and the Senegal River delta and valley. We consider three consecutive rainy seasons (July-November 2014, 2015 and 2016) and account for several vector and animal species. We parametrize our model with estimates of Aedes vexans arabiensis, Culex poicilipes, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, cattle, sheep and goat abundances. The impact of RVF virus introduction is assessed every week over northern Senegal. We highlight September as the period of highest epidemic potential in northern Senegal, resulting from distinct dynamics in the two study areas. Spatially, in the seasonal envi­ ronment of the Ferlo, we observe that high-risk locations vary between years. We show that decreased vector densities do not greatly reduce R0 and that cattle immunity has a greater impact on reducing transmission than small ruminant immunity. The host preferences of vectors and the temperature-dependent time interval between their blood meals are crucial parameters needing further biological investigations.},

	title = {Environmental heterogeneity drives tsetse fly population dynamics},
	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/493650},
	abstract = {A spatially and temporally heterogeneous environment may lead to unexpected population dynamics. Knowledge still is needed on which of the local environment properties favour population maintenance at larger scale. For pathogen vectors, such as tsetse flies transmitting human and animal African trypanosomosis, such a knowledge is crucial to design relevant management strategies. We developed an original mechanistic spatio-temporal model of tsetse fly population dynamics, accounting for combined effects of spatial complexity, density-dependence, and temperature on the age-structured population, and parametrized with field and laboratory data. We confirmed the strong impact of temperature and adult mortality on tsetse populations. We showed that the coldest cells with the smallest variations in temperature acted as refuges when adult mortality was homogeneously increased, control being less effective in such refuges. In contrast, optimizing control by targeting the cells contributing the most to population management resulted in a decline in population size with a similar efficacy, but resulted in more dispersed individuals, control efficacy being no longer related to temperature. Population resurgence after control was slow, but could be very high locally in refuges. Situations were highly contrasted after a heterogeneous control, refuges being located at the interface between controlled and uncontrolled zones. Our results highlighted the importance of baseline data collection to characterize the targeted ecosystem before any control measure is implemented.},
