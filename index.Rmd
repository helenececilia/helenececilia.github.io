## Bio

I am a mathematical modeler, specialized in the ecology and epidemiology of vector-borne, zoonotic diseases.

I have studied the impact of abiotic factors on the population dynamics of insect vectors, and how the fragmentation of the habitat due to human activites can create source-sink dynamics that can jeopardize control efforts. I have mapped the epidemic potential of complex multi-host, multi-vector systems in a seasonal environment. I have also worked at the within-host scale, comparing viral dynamics and host-to-vector transmission patterns of different vertberate host species and viral strains. 

My research interests are now focused on assessing the impact of individual heterogeneities on transmission dynamics at the population scale, and, methodologically, on the best approach to couple these different scales. I mostly use mechanistic modeling, but I can also use statistical models, particularly to exploit experimental data. 

Please reach out if you think a collaboration could be of interest, or if you're a prospective master/PhD student, or postdoc. I'm also very keen on scientific outreach activities.
