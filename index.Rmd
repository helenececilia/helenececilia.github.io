## Bio

I'm a mathematical modeler, primarily interested in epidemiology and ecology. So far, I've worked on issues regarding transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases and population dynamics of insect vectors. I mostly use mechanistic modeling, at different scales : from countrywide risk mapping to within-host viral dynamics. 

**I'm open to postdoc opportunities, drop me an email if you think I could be a good fit for your team!**

I'm also very keen on scientific outreach activities. I talked about my own research in  [Soapbox Science](http://soapboxscience.org/) and [Skype a scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/). I volunteered for [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.com/) and [Labo des Savoirs](https://labodessavoirs.fr/) (weekly scientific radio program, in french).
