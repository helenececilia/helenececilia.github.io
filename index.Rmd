## Bio

I'm a mathematical modeler, primarily interested in epidemiology and ecology. So far, I've worked on issues regarding transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases and population dynamics of insect vectors. I mostly use mechanistic modeling, at different scales : from countrywide risk mapping to within-host viral dynamics. 

I'm also very keen on scientific outreach activities. I sometimes write columns or do interviews for [Labo des Savoirs](https://labodessavoirs.fr/) (weekly scientific radio program, in french). I talked about my own research in  [Soapbox Science](http://soapboxscience.org/), [Skype a scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/) and [Nuit Blanche des Chercheurs](https://nbc.univ-nantes.fr/) (in french). I also volunteered in the organizing team of [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.com/) a few years ago.
